KINEXON's xBall technology is revolutionizing soccer by providing detailed, real-time data on the ball’s movement. Unlike traditional sensor-enabled balls, the xBall is perfectly balanced, ensuring its natural flight and handling aren't affected. It uses ultra-wideband (UWB) and inertial measurement unit (IMU) technologies to track the ball’s location, speed, spin, and direction. The data is sent to a network of antennas around the field and processed by KINEXON’s software, giving coaches and analysts insights into each touch, pass, and shot. This system also syncs with player tracking, offering a complete view of player and ball movements for more accurate game analysis.
