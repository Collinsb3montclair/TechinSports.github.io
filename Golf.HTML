Golf simulators use advanced technology, including sensors, cameras, and software, to analyze swings and shots, offering detailed feedback on aspects like club speed, ball trajectory, spin rates, and shot accuracy. Radar-based systems track ball flight, while high-speed cameras capture swing details for real-time feedback. Optical sensors track ball angles, and sensor mats measure contact data. Simulators also account for environmental factors like wind, terrain, and obstacles. Key metrics such as angle of attack, club head speed, and spin rate are tracked to help golfers improve. Golf simulators provide a realistic, customizable practice experience, ideal for players of all skill levels.
