Radar guns, now essential in baseball, were first introduced in 1974 by Danny Litwhiler, a former MLB outfielder. Inspired by radar's use in law enforcement, Litwhiler developed the first handheld radar gun for baseball to measure pitch speeds and speed differentials. Radar works on the Doppler Effect, detecting frequency shifts to calculate velocity. Advanced systems like TrackMan and StatCast go beyond speed, capturing pitch trajectory, spin rate, and direction, offering deeper insights into player performance. These technologies are vital for analysts, coaches, and players, enhancing strategic decisions and contributing to modern baseball analytics.
